##Sampling parameters##
#######################

#Music is sampled this number of times per second 30 - 60 is good.
sound_sample_frequency 40.0

#Disregard notes in higher octaves than this, 6 is good.
max_octave 6

#Disregard notes in lower octaves than this, 1 - 2 is good.
min_octave 1

#Each sample is this width, in bytes. Should be a power of two, 16384 is a good value, rarely needs to be changed.
sample_width_bytes 16384

#We maintain a rolling average of each notes intensity as the song is sampled. Notes which exceed this are triggered. 0.1 - 1 works well.
intensity_accumulation_secs 0.1

#How many times greater than the intensity must be than the average for the note to be triggered. Depends of the audio used, 1.5 - 2.0 is usually good.
intensity_trigger_threshold 1.87

#When searching for sets of notes which are the same, we can add a tolerance threshold. Setting these higher will cause the model to see many
#different sets of notes the same. These are advanced options, and should probably not be changed. Setting them both to 1 occasionally creates interesting
#results.
noteset_similarity_tolerance_build 0
noteset_similarity_tolerance_runtime 0

##Simulation parameters##
#########################

#The ambient friction in the scene. The greater the value, the slower the nodes will collect.
ambient_friction 0.55

#0 means that nodes will resolve collision as soon as they collide. 1 means they will pass through one another.
penetration_leniency 0.5

#When nodes get close to one another, an extra friction-like force is applied. This value is its multiplier.
stickiness 0.9

#The radius multiplier for the effect of this force. 1.0 is exactly the radius of the node.
stickiness_radius_mul 1.0

#The coefficient of restitution of each node. Has little effect.
collision_energy_conservation 0.1

#How sharply gravity attenuates. 2.0 produces true results, 1.0 tends to work better, with high friction.
gravity_attentuation 1.0

#Set these both to -1 to detect the screen dimensions automatically.
